# Lucky
This is my pile of tools (one might call it a framework) for building games in C++. Everything here is experimental and prone to regular API breakage and redesign.

If you want something more stable (and actually good) I recommend checkout out [raylib](www.raylib.com).

## Creating examples
Run the following command to generage a new example project at cpp file:
`./make_example.sh ExampleName`

`ExampleName` will be used in the filenames and should not contain any spaces or restricted special characters.
